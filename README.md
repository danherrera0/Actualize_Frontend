Welcome to Actualize!

Actualize is a drag and drop task manager inspired by Trello and Scrum Methodology. I built actualize because Iâ€™m obsessed with organization and efficiency. 

The backend is built using Ruby on Rails and the front end is built with Vanilla JavaScript, React.js and custom CSS.

To implement the drag and drop feature I used the React Beautiful DND library.

You can add, move, and delete tasks and see your progress change with each action.There is also a success gif that will pop up every time you drag a task into the complete column , the gif shown is randomized each time.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
