Welcome to Actualize!

Actualize is a drag and drop task manager inspired by Trello and Scrum Methodology. I built actualize because Iâ€™m obsessed with organization and efficiency. 

The backend is built using Ruby on Rails and the front end is built with Vanilla JavaScript, React.js and custom CSS.

To implement the drag and drop feature I used the React Beautiful DND library.

You can add, move, and delete tasks and see your progress change with each action.There is also a success gif that will pop up every time you drag a task into the complete column , the gif shown is randomized each time.
